  <title>The Future Is Mastodon</title>

  <p><h1>What is the Fediverse?</h1>
  <p>Before I can explain why I think the Fediverse should, but most likely will not, be the future for all, I must explain exactly what the Fediverse is. The Fediverse is the social media where all can post, without any restrictions. While the most-known part of the Fediverse is Mastodon, others do exist. The defining feature of Mastodon— as with all Fediversal applications— is that no one can take control of the whole service. They do this via the propagation of their own servers, or, in the jargon of Fediverse, their own instances. It wouldn't be much fun if that were all there was to it—after all, it's just a fancy Discord at that point, and Discord, remember, is not federated. What makes the Fediverse unique is that, via a little ditty called ActivityPub, all instances can share the same content while still being segmented! Imagine the Fediverse as a feudal society, hence the name Fediverse (that is, the feudal universe). Each person— each user— has their own group, the one that is registered with their same instance, where they signed up. But they can still see Leo Laporte on his own instance without having to make an account on twit.tv’s instance. This, as I will describe later, is useful, as you can exit and start over without a chore. The only thing you might need to do is migrate their data. But Exit— while inconvenient— is the key to making a fair, equal world for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><h1>Federated content and the idea of Exit</h1>
  <p>Fediverse allows users to leave any one instance with minimal punishment, allowing for the illusion of Exit and allowing admins to make their own rules. ActivityPub ensures that all can see all, regardless of which society they are in.</p>
  <p>Contrast this idea to that of typical social media, which is owned by a corporation or, in rarer cases, an individual or non-profit and can be censored at any time. Even worse, many groups don’t have a presence on any social media site, and they cannot communicate with each other. This makes islands out of people, where they cannot recover the data that they give, and Big Tech has sway over their data and where it goes when it is no longer being stored on their servers. This leads to dicey situations such as the Cambridge Analytica and Meta scandals. At that point (which many social media have already reached), Exit is all but impossible since anyone in charge of said media has the right to silence anyone they want. This isn’t good, and Federation prevents that from happening. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, why is Fediverse the future of technology?
  <p>I think that this idea— the idea that everyone can leave but still be connected to one another— is not only the future of technology but can radically change how people interact with each other. This forms an "island" around which a society can be formed. Each Fediverse instance can be considered its own group of people, akin to— guess what?—a society. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the start of a network state. In a network state, all can participate with impunity yet have a global presence. I do think that by siloing all who wish to be siloed into their own tribes, as it were, much conflict can be avoided. Granted, we will never avoid all conflict, but when the inevitable conflict ends up happening, they can exit. Imagine now if each instance— each different country— ended up combining their forces, but still having the Fediversal ideal set that "anyone can leave, and anyone can control a small part" of the world. It’s feudalism, but fairer than that of the Middle Ages. Once again, Exit is a crucial part of the network state, but organizing a nation is useless without diplomatic recognition. Making a verification system that ensures federated servers are who they say they are without destroying what federation is would help. Just having your own verified server on your own website could help in that case. There is a potential hassle in tying verification to a specific server location or address, which may hinder those who wish to have their own instance. But I believe that, to have true diplomacy, a sort of anchor must be set. Now this could be an issue; after all, the whole idea of the Fediverse is to not have something like this and to decentralize it. People, however, need this structure to build trust.</p>
  <p>Trust is what makes the Fediverse better than normal social media. If someone can trust the administrator of a Fediverse instance, then it’ll prosper. Yet, if people find that they cannot trust them for whatever reason, then the server will die. This creates a check and balance that ensures that this is true, much like any nation-state should.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><h1>But why is Mastodon <i>not</i> going to be the future of the internet?</h1>
  <p>Despite all its pros, there are still some problems with Mastodon and ActivityPub that need to be addressed. First, Mastodon specifically struggles with marketing as it grows in popularity. When Mastodon first came back into the zeitgeist after Musk bought Twitter, almost no one knew what Mastodon was. And, as Cambridge Analytica and Meta showed, people are not likely to join a new social media platform without a clear value proposition and trustworthy privacy policies. However, Mastodon's emphasis on decentralization and user-controlled communities has the potential to attract a niche audience looking for a more autonomous online experience. Without good marketing, however, anything that starts that way will remain just that. Mastodon is a free, non-ad-supported service, and to remain such, it needs funding. But when you have a smaller, more niche userbase, not much money will flow.</p>
  <p>Another issue is that it doesn't want to change. One of my fellow tooters on Mastodon () said, in effect, that there is an imbalance between what Twitter is and what Mastodon is. To quote them directly:</p>
  <p><blockquote>It's the notion of not just making it into a Twitter clone... but then just about every technical means is taken to ensure it neither outgrows that status (of basically being a clone) nor becomes more versatile.</blockquote</p>
  <p>They made a good point there, in that their unwillingness to change will not help them get more people. I think that ditching this idea—wanting to keep Mastodon different from Twitter— is one of the biggest things that would be helpful to get more people to switch to Mastodon itself from Facebook, Instagram, and other services.</p>
  <p>However, I do still think that Mastodon can fix their issues and become the social media platform everyone will use.</p>
  <p><h1>How Mastodon can fix its crucial errors</h1>
  <p>I still believe that this boat has not set sail yet. While Mastodon is new in social media (the first release on its GitHub was March 16th, 2016), it has been shadowed by the Big Three social media companies: Meta, Twitter, and Snap. I think that the company behind Mastodon must attempt to prove themselves by using the fact that all three have had their share of issues, and Mastodon has not. That is, after all, true— Meta and Cambridge Analytica, the shitstorm at Twitter, and Snap's omnipresence. Using these privacy concerns as a touchpoint, people will most likely realize that Mastodon is better than those sites and start migrating to it.</p>
  <p><h1>Upshot</h1></p>
  <p>The Fediverse is a social media platform where everyone can post without any restrictions. It is unique in that it allows all instances to share the same content while still being segmented. Each user has their own group, is registered with their same instance, and can exit and start over without a chore. Exit is the key to making a fair, equal world for everyone. Fediverse allows users to leave any one instance with minimal punishment, allowing admins to make their own rules. This contrasts with typical social media. These are owned by a corporation, an individual, or a non-profit and can be censored. This makes islands out of people, and Big Tech has sway over their data, leading to scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and Meta. The idea that everyone can leave but still be connected to one another is the future of technology and can radically change how people interact with each other. This is the start of a network state, where all can participate with impunity yet have a global presence. Exit is a crucial part of the network state, but organizing a nation is useless without diplomatic recognition. A verification system that ensures federated servers are who they say they are without destroying what federation is would help in that case. Trust is what makes the Fediverse better than normal social media, as if someone can trust the administrator of a Fediverse instance, then it will prosper. Yet, Mastodon and ActivityPub have a number of issues that need to be addressed, such as their lack of marketing and unwillingness to change. Mastodon is a free, non-ad-supported service, and to remain such, it needs funding. However, its emphasis on decentralization and user-controlled communities has the potential to attract a niche audience looking for a more autonomous online experience. Ditching this idea would help get more people to switch to Mastodon itself from Facebook, Instagram, and other services. Mastodon must use the Big Three social media companies' issues as a touchpoint to convince people that it is better than them, and thus set in motion what I have explained here.</p>
