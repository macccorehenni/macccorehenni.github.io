<h1>Thoughts on Technology</h1>
This is my Thoughts on Technology page, where I hope to collect all my thoughts on technology as I come up with them.
<h2>TODO, or the WIPs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copyright? No way!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Works of art, or those that are finished</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Mastodon.html">Why Mastodon should, but isn't, the future of society</a></li>
<h2>Copyright</h2> 
I believe in all technology being free, meaning that, unless stated otherwise, any project I make is <a href=https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode>CC-0</a>. While not neccesary, attribution is appreciated. Thanks so much for reading them, now go wild! (BUT...... not too wild.)
